# Connecting it all up

Connect the DTC as follows:

Power the device from any DC source 5V source via the power supply jack. The jack will be centre pin positive.

NTC thermistors are plugged in to J2 and J3 on the PCB. Polarity is not important for these devices.

Connect your fan in series with the centre and left most pins on the 3 way connector relay output.

## A word of warning

If you choose to power the external fan from 110/240V via the onboard relay, **you do so at your own risk.** While the relay is rated for this voltage and the PCB traces have adequate separation from the other traces, this voltage is dangerous and should only be attempted by suitably qualified/experienced people.
